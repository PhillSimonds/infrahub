# Release 0.16.0

## Main changes

### Unified storage

#### Git repository management

The integration with external Git Repositories is very important to Infrahub, and major user experience improvements were implemented in v0.16.

As a user, it is now easier to manage Git repositories and to understand and troubleshoot the situation when things are not working as expected.

Added/changed features include:

  - Improvements to identifying the state of the repository
  - Additional logging and notifications, for example if authentication to the repository is not working
  - Deleting a repository will delete the associated resources
  - The supplied Git URL does not need to have the `.git` suffix, Infrahub will automatically handle this

See the documentation for more information on using Git repositories with Infrahub:

- [Guides - Adding/updating external repositories](https://docs.infrahub.app/guides/repository)
- [Topics - Repository](https://docs.infrahub.app/topics/repository)
