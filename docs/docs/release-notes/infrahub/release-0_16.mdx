# Release 0.16.0

## Main changes

### Object management

#### Number resource pool

Users can now create a Resource pool for Numbers (integers) as well as IP Addresses/Prefixes.

This will enable users to assign items such as AS Number from a pool, and is managed via a Resource Manager the same way that IP Addresses/Prefixes are:

See the Resource Manager documentation for more information on managing and utilizing Resource Pools:

- [Tutorials - Resource Manager](/tutorials/getting-started/resource-manager)

### Unified storage

#### Git repository management

The integration with external Git Repositories is very important to Infrahub, and major user experience improvements were implemented in v0.16.

As a user, it is now easier to manage Git repositories and to understand and troubleshoot the situation when things are not working as expected.

Added/changed features include:

- Improvements to identifying the state of the repository
- Additional logging and notifications, for example if authentication to the repository is not working
- Deleting a repository will delete the associated resources
- The supplied Git URL does not need to have the `.git` suffix, Infrahub will automatically handle this

See the documentation for more information on using Git repositories with Infrahub:

- [Guides - Adding/updating external repositories](/guides/repository)
- [Topics - Repository](/topics/repository)

### Schema

### Frontend

#### Branch diff view improvements

There were many improvements to how the Proposed Change diff between branches is shown.

For example:

- 

#### Filter internal groups

Infrahub makes extensive use of Groups internally for features such as Generators.

However, these groups can clutter and confuse the Group assignment/editing user experience.

In v0.16.0, these groups are now hidden by default but can be made visible via an `auto-generated` toggle on the Group management screen as shown below:

import HideAutoGeneratedGroups from '../../media/release_notes/infrahub_0_16_0/hide_auto_generated_groups.png';

<img
  src={HideAutoGeneratedGroups}
  alt="Example of the button to hide 'auto-generated' groups."
  style={{width: 500}}
/>
